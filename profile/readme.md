# About Primus

Primus (formerly "PADO") is a cryptographic infrastructure that enables any web data to be validated, and further to be encrypted and processed. With cutting-edge techniques including secure multi-party computation (MPC), fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), Primus provides authenticated data and confidential computation for data-driven dApps with both verifiability and privacy guarantees. 

Primus always seeks a secure and compliant way to build products with user-centric design for end-users and developers.  

About Primus Labs: We are firm believers in advanced cryptography techniques.
